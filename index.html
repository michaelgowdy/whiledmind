        <section class="about-container">
            <p>Whiled Mind believes the experience and relationship of therapy to be a curative factor—an antidote to our pain.</p>

            <p>It is an utmost honor to co-labor in the therapeutic journey with clients. In such, we remain tenderly curious stepping into clients’ stories, while also remembering the greater context of individuals. Whiled Mind aims to create a brave and safe space with warmth and hospitality where individuals can pursue honesty and freely express to heal from their pain and its deeper roots.
            The therapeutic relationship sees people for who they are and who they are becoming, believing the process of therapy to be both healing and practical.</p>
            
            <p>Payton Gowdy is certified as a Level 1 Restoration Therapist and actively employs these principles in her practice, working with individuals of all ages and uniquely crafting sessions for individual needs.
            Payton earned a Bachelor of Arts in English from Oklahoma State University and a Master of Arts in Counseling from West Texas A&M University.
            She has worked abroad throughout multiple countries and with individuals of all ages and backgrounds in her time working in Higher Ed.; Payton is currently licensed as a Licensed Professional Counselor in the state of Texas.</p>
            
            <p>Outside of work, Payton enjoys traveling, reading, cooking, and being creative with her hands. She loves slowing down and whiling away with her family.</p>
            
            
            <p>What’s in the name?</p>
            <p>Whiled— verb: to slow down, allowing time to pass in an easy or pleasant way.
            Much of the process of therapy hinges on our ability to slow down, take inventory, gain awareness, sit with ourselves/ with our pain, and get curious before judgmental. If we can slow and steady ourselves with compassionate curiosity, we can begin to put these connections in the light to learn and grow from them. In this time, we can honor our experience and emotions and practice self control. We can learn to tame our “wild” mind.</p>
